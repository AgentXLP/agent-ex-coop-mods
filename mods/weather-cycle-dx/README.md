# Weather Cycle DX

This mod adds a weather cycle system with rain and storms to sm64coopdx. It uses Day Night Cycle DX as a base library, meaning you need to have it enabled in order to use this mod. There is also a toggleable Aurora Borealis that starts after midnight.


Special thanks to Floralys for the original concept.
